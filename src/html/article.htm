        Esports is the natural continuation of our path. Our story beganin 2019,
        when Parivision first stepped onto the esports stage. We brought
        together gamers, streamers, creators, and future-thinkers to prove that
        gaming is more than just play — it’s culture. From day one, we’ve pushed
        against expectations. Together with our community, we pioneered new
        formats — from interactive show matches and educational streams to
        fashion drops with local brands and documentary-style stories about the
        people behind the games.

        We’ve partnered with Riot Games, launched special projects for YouTube,
        and redefined what gaming content can be. Our merch made its way into
        the streets, and the voice of the team echoed through podcasts,
        tournaments, and the hearts of players. Parivision is a platform for
        those who think freely. And it all started with home setups, a dream,
        and the belief that digital culture is the new main stage.
